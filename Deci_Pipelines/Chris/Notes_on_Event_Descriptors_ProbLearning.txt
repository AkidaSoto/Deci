## Notes on event descriptors for Probabilistic_Learning Experiment

#Stim Conditions
14 = AB
15 = CD
16 = EF


#Stim Formats(L/R)
41 = AB --> Left is optimal resp
42 = BA --> Right is optimal resp


#Response(L/R)
37 = Resp Left
38 = Resp Right


#Response(cor/inc) --> *Note: this is linked with Feedback. 31 always goes with 23, 34 always goes with 22
31 = incorrect resp
34 = correct resp


#Response(optimal/non-optimal)
300 = optimal resp (i.e. A,C, or E depending on the stim condition)     --> either [format = 41 + resp = 37] or [format = 42 + resp = 38] 
301 = non-optimal resp (i.e. B,D, or F depending on the stim condition) --> either [format = 41 + resp = 38] or [format = 42 + resp = 37] 


#Feedback
22 = Fdb correct
23 = Fdb incorrect


#This dictates whether A (C/E) is correct or incorrect. The percentage of 51 per stim condition per block should be 80%, 70% and 60% respectively.
51 = A_Correct???
52 = A_Incorrect???



*Note:
Feedback (cond_info column 6) is dependent on whether or not the response is correct (cond_info column 4). The correctness of the response is
dependednt on whether A is correct (51) or A is incorrect(52) (cond_info column 6). For condition AB there should be 80% A_Correct (51) and 20%
A_Incorrect (52). For condition CD there should be 70% A_Correct (51) and 30% A_Incorrect (52). For condition EF there should be 60% A_Correct 
(51) and 20% A_Incorrect (52). However, it appears to be the case that A_Correct is 70% (A_Incorrect 30%) for all 3 conditions.
